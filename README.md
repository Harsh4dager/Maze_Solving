# Maze Solving Algorithms

This repository contains a Python implementation of different maze-solving algorithms, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS), and A* Search. These algorithms can be used to find a path from a start point to a goal point within a given maze.

## Features

- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)
- A* Search
- Visualization of maze and solution path

## Usage

To solve a maze using any of the algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Create a maze text file, where:
   - '#' represents walls
   - 'A' represents the start point
   - 'B' represents the goal point
   - ' ' represents empty cells

2. Run the Python script `maze.py` and provide the path to the maze text file as a command-line argument.

For example:

```bash
python maze.py maze.txt
```

3. Run the script `Start maze.png` to see visuall representation  as a command-line argument.

For example:

```bash
start maze.png
```
